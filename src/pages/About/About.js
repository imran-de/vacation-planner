                            Back in 1996 we were just a bunch of uni friends who wanted to go sailing and explore far and wide. Today, weâ€™re still that same bunch of friends, only now there are 70,000 of us. And our loving family just keeps getting bigger. We have forged a community from adventurous spirits, vast open waters, and a host of musicians, collaborators, sailors and revellers.
